# RPG-Engine

The original goal of this project was to create a game engine using Monogame. I never really expected it to go all the way through, as this is just practice with come new C# concepts.

Actually completing this has grabbed my interest a bit more, so I will be moving this over to Unity3D in order to make some actual progress.


Current features:
- Renders a grid, uses a raycast to highlight tiles on said grid.
- Write class data to JSON using json.NET.
- (poorly) Render a model of the table te grid was going to go on.
- That's it. Super short project.
